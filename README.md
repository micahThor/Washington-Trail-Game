# Washington-Trail

SUMMARY:: Our project is a text-based adventure game themed around a commute towards Seattle. The player of the game will start with a set budget, time, and health to reach the final location. The game will prompt the user to make transportation choices. Each transportation option has different trade-offs in consequences in regards to the player's budget, time, and health. The result of the game is determined if the player arrived at the final location within time, budget, and health.
